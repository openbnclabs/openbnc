> Bridging the gap between crypto infrastructure and autonomous AI agents.

## What is openbnc?

openbnc is an experimental open-source project exploring what happens when you put autonomous AI agents at the heart of crypto infrastructure.

We believe the next chapter of decentralized technology isn't just about money moving between wallets — it's about intelligent agents that can reason, act, and collaborate on behalf of their users. openbnc is our attempt to build that bridge: a lightweight, self-hostable AI agent runtime designed from the ground up with the crypto-native world in mind.

This is not a finished product. It is an experiment — and we think the most interesting experiments happen in public.

## Vision

The crypto ecosystem has built remarkable infrastructure for trustless value exchange. The AI ecosystem has built remarkable infrastructure for intelligent automation. Yet the two worlds remain largely separate, connected only by clumsy integrations and fragile wrappers.

openbnc asks a simple question: **what if AI agents were first-class citizens of the decentralized web?**

We envision a future where:

- Anyone can deploy a personal AI agent that operates autonomously on their behalf
- Agents can interact with on-chain protocols natively, without centralized intermediaries
- AI compute and crypto-economic incentives align to create a self-sustaining ecosystem
- The barrier between "running an AI" and "participating in a network" disappears entirely

This vision is ambitious. We are starting small, iterating in the open, and inviting the community to help shape what openbnc becomes.

## Core Principles

**Autonomous by default.** Agents deployed on openbnc are designed to act independently — not as passive chatbots waiting for prompts, but as active participants capable of scheduling tasks, monitoring conditions, and taking meaningful actions.

**Self-hostable and sovereign.** You own your agent. openbnc is built to run on your hardware, your server, or your local machine. No platform lock-in. No data harvested by a third party.

**Provider-agnostic.** We don't believe any single AI model will win forever. openbnc supports multiple AI providers so you can swap the underlying intelligence without rebuilding your setup.

**Open and experimental.** We are sharing this work early because we think the questions openbnc is asking matter — and because the best answers will come from a community, not a single team.

## Status

openbnc is currently in early experimental development. APIs will change. Things will break. That's intentional.

If you're the kind of person who finds that exciting rather than alarming, you're in the right place.
